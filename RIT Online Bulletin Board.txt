RIT Online Bulletin Board

Only for RIT students -- check for "@rit.edu" in sign in input, and/or send a verification email with a link
	Issue: getting flagged as phishing maybe

Problems:
	Scaling (down the line)
	Moderation
		content filters, other ???

Why do we care:
	There is currently no RIT-specific bulletin board-esque site or service other than Discord, Instagram, and Snapchat. 
	Will be used for: buy/sell, event listings, announcements

Features to add:
	Sort by newest/most interacted with
